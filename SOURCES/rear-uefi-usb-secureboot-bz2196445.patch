    Merge pull request #3031 from rear/jsmeix-USB-Secure-Boot
    
    Secure Boot support for OUTPUT=USB:
    In output/USB/Linux-i386/100_create_efiboot.sh
    added SECURE_BOOT_BOOTLOADER related code that is based
    on the code in output/ISO/Linux-i386/250_populate_efibootimg.sh
    with some adaptions to make it work within the existing USB code.
    The basic idea for Secure Boot booting of the ReaR recovery system
    is to "just copy" the (signed) EFI binaries of the Linux distribution
    (shim*.efi and grub*.efi as first and second stage UEFI bootloaders)
    instead of let ReaR make its own EFI binary via build_bootx86_efi()
    see https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/3031

 # Copy boot loader
+# The SECURE_BOOT_BOOTLOADER related code below is based on the code in output/ISO/Linux-i386/250_populate_efibootimg.sh
+# because I <jsmeix@suse.de> noticed that Secure Boot works with ISO at least for me, cf.
+# https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/3025#issuecomment-1635876186
+# but not with USB, cf.
+# https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/3025#issuecomment-1643774477
+# so I tried to re-use the ISO Secure Boot code for USB
+# which made Secure Boot "just work" for me with USB
+# but I had to do some (minor) adaptions to make it work
+# within the existing USB code, cf.
