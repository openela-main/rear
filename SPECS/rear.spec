Patch206: rear-nbu-RHEL-17390-RHEL-17393.patch

# support "export TMPDIR" again, temporarily, with a warning.
Patch207: rear-support-export-TMPDIR.patch

# rear contains only bash scripts plus documentation so that on first glance it could be "BuildArch: noarch"
# but actually it is not "noarch" because it only works on those architectures that are explicitly supported.
# Of course the rear bash scripts can be installed on any architecture just as any binaries can be installed on any architecture.
# But the meaning of architecture dependent packages should be on what architectures they will work.
# Therefore only those architectures that are actually supported are explicitly listed.
# This avoids that rear can be "just installed" on architectures that are actually not supported (e.g. ARM):
ExclusiveArch: %ix86 x86_64 ppc ppc64 ppc64le ia64 s390x
# Furthermore for some architectures it requires architecture dependent packages (like syslinux for x86 and x86_64)
# so that rear must be architecture dependent because ifarch conditions never match in case of "BuildArch: noarch"
# see the GitHub issue https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/629
%ifarch %ix86 x86_64
Requires: syslinux
# We need mkfs.vfat for recreating EFI System Partition
Recommends: dosfstools
%endif
%ifarch ppc ppc64 ppc64le
# Called by grub2-install (except on PowerNV)
Requires:   /usr/sbin/ofpathname
# Needed to make PowerVM LPARs bootable
Requires:   /usr/sbin/bootlist
%endif
%ifarch s390x
# Contain many utilities for working with DASDs
Requires:   s390utils-base
Requires:   s390utils-core
%endif
# In the end this should tell the user that rear is known to work only on ix86 x86_64 ppc ppc64 ppc64le ia64
# and on ix86 x86_64 syslinux is explicitly required to make the bootable ISO image
# (in addition to the default installed bootloader grub2) while on ppc ppc64 the
# default installed bootloader yaboot is also useed to make the bootable ISO image.

%description
Relax-and-Recover is the leading Open Source disaster recovery and system
migration solution. It comprises of a modular
frame-work and ready-to-go workflows for many common situations to produce
a bootable image and restore from backup using this image. As a benefit,
it allows to restore to different hardware and can therefore be used as
a migration tool as well.

Currently Relax-and-Recover supports various boot media (incl. ISO, PXE,
OBDR tape, USB or eSATA storage), a variety of network protocols (incl.
sftp, ftp, http, nfs, cifs) as well as a multitude of backup strategies
(incl.  IBM TSM, MircroFocus Data Protector, Symantec NetBackup, EMC NetWorker,
Bacula, Bareos, BORG, Duplicity, rsync).

Relax-and-Recover was designed to be easy to set up, requires no maintenance
and is there to assist when disaster strikes. Its setup-and-forget nature
removes any excuse for not having a disaster recovery solution implemented.

Professional services and support are available.
